/// A trait for executing blockchain-related operations.

/// The `Run` trait abstracts the logic for running operations
/// in both single-threaded and multi-threaded environments. It's designed
/// for applications that interact with blockchain data, allowing for
/// flexible implementation of data fetching, processing, and storage.
///
/// This trait is particularly useful for managing the execution flow
/// of blockchain data processing tasks, whether running sequentially or
/// in parallel (when enabled through feature flags).
